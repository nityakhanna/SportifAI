                            Mental health, specially in the Indian society is considered a taboo topic. Rather than raising awareness about them, mental illnesses are often dismissed. It is important to be educated and aware of different mental illnesses and how to cope with them. I have compiled some information on a few of them and also provided links to related articles and videos. In addition to this, I have also provided links to websites with helpline numbers, in case of an emergency.

<h3><i><b>OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR:</b></i></h3>
<br>Obsessive behaviours stem from obsessive thoughts, persistent urges, intrusive mental images, or an unwanted emotional pull that causes distress, anxiety, and disturbance of a person's daily routine.
Obsessive behaviours are intrusive, recurring, and uncontrollable thoughts and behaviours limit a person’s ability to enjoy life. <br><br>

<h4>COMMON OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOURS</h4>

<ul>
<li>Repeatedly checking to make sure that doors and windows are locked or that appliances are turned off. </li>

<li>Excessive cleaning of the house, clothes and/or body.</li>

<li>Counting objects, letters, words or just about anything.</li>

<li>Rearranging objects to ensure a specific order and/or symmetry.</li>

<li>Doing things in multiples. For instance, turning the light on and off five times because five is a "good" number.
</li></ul>
<br>

<h4>COMMON OBSESSIVE THOUGHTS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fear of being contaminated by germs or dirt or contaminating others</li>

<li>Fear of losing control and harming yourself or others</li>

<li>Excessive focus on religious or moral ideas</li>

<li>Fear of losing or not having things you might need</li>

<li>Order and symmetry: the idea that everything must line up “just right”</li>

<li>Superstitions; excessive attention to something considered lucky or unlucky</ul>


<br>
<h4>TREATMENTS</h4>

Obsessive behaviours can often be dramatically reduced using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP). 
<br>
<ul>
<li>Identify your triggers: Record a list of the triggers you experience each day and the obsessions they provoke. Rate the intensity of the fear or anxiety you experienced in each situation and then the compulsions or mental strategies you used to ease your anxiety.</li>

<li>Learn to resist Compulsions: By repeatedly exposing yourself to your OCD triggers, you can learn to resist the urge to complete your compulsive rituals. </li>

<li>Reach out for support: OCD can get worse when you feel powerless and alone, so it’s important to build a strong support system. The more connected you are to other people, the less vulnerable you’ll feel.</li>

<li>Manage stress: While stress doesn’t cause OCD, it can trigger symptoms or make them worse. Physical exercise and connecting with another person face-to-face are two very effective ways to calm your nervous system.</li>
</ul>

<h3><i><b>ANXIETY:</b></i></h3>
<br>
<h4>ANXIETY DISORDERS</h4>
Anxiety is your body’s natural response to stress. However, if your feelings of anxiety are extreme, last for longer than six months, and are interfering with your life, you may have an anxiety disorder.
<br>An anxiety disorder involve excessive fear or anxiety. It can affect anyone at any age and is a key part of several different disorders including panic disorders, phobias, social anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive behaviours and many more.<br>
<br><br>
<h4>SYMPTOMS</h4>

Feelings of anxiety can range from butterflies in your stomach to a racing heart. You might feel out of control, like there’s a disconnect between your mind and body or may even have nightmares, panic attacks, and painful thoughts or memories that you can’t control. You may have a general feeling of fear and worry, or you may fear a specific place or event.<br>
<br><br>

<h4>ANXIETY ATTACKS AND PANIC ATTACKS</h4>

An anxiety attack is a feeling of overwhelming apprehension, worry, distress, or fear. For many people, an anxiety attack builds slowly. It may worsen as a stressful event approaches. 

<br>Panic Attacks ,on the other hand, come on suddenly and involve intense and often overwhelming fear. They’re accompanied by frightening physical symptoms, such as a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, or nausea. 

<br>During a panic attack, the body’s autonomous fight-or-flight response takes over. Physical symptoms are often more intense than symptoms of anxiety. Panic attacks also typically trigger worries or fears related to having another attack. This may have an effect on your behaviour, leading you to avoid places or situations where you think you might be at risk of a panic attack.<br>
<br><br>

<h4>ANXIETY AND TEENS</h4>

Symptoms of anxiety in teenagers may include nervousness, shyness, isolationist behaviours, and avoidance. Teenagers suffering from anxiety may act out, perform poorly in school, skip social events, and even engage in substance or alcohol use. For some teens, depression may accompany anxiety.<br><br>

   <h3><i><b>BINGE-EATING:</b></i></h3>
<br>
<h4>BINGE EATING DISORDER</h4>
People with Binge Eating Disorder may eat a lot of food in a short amount of time, even if they aren’t hungry. This may be triggered by emotional stress or destress.
Feeding and eating disorders are not about food alone, which is why they’re recognized as psychiatric disorders. People typically develop them as a way of dealing with a deeper issue or another psychological condition, such as anxiety or depression.<br>
<br><br>

<h4>SYMPTOMS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eating much more rapidly than normal
<li>Eating until uncomfortably full
<li>Eating large amounts without feeling hungry
<li>Eating alone due to feelings of embarrassment and shame
<li>Feelings of guilt or disgust with oneself</ul> 

<br>
<h4>CAUSES</h4>

Binge eating disorder can be cause by biological abnormalities, such as hormonal irregularities or genetic mutations, or by depression, body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and difficulty coping with feelings. Traumatic situations and social pressures can also increase the risk of binge eating.<br>
<br><br>

<h4>TREATMENTS</h4>

Professional support and treatment from health professionals specializing in the treatment of binge eating disorders, including psychiatrists, nutritionists, and therapists, can be the most effective way to address BED.
<br> <br>
There are also three types of therapy that can be especially helpful: 
<ul>
<li>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy:
Mbr>A type of therapy aimed at helping individuals understand the thoughts and feelings that influence their behaviours.
<li>Interpersonal Psychotherapy: 
<br>A form of therapy in which the focus is on an individual’s relationships with family members and peers and the way they see themselves.
<li>Dialectical Behaviour Therapy: 
<br>A type of therapy that focuses on teaching individuals skills to cope with stress and regulate emotions.

        <h3><i><b>COPING MECHANISMS:</b></i></h3>
        <br>
<h4>SOME COPING MECHANISMS</h4>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Accept that there are events you cannot control: Acceptance may be difficult, but in the long run, it’s easier than railing against a situation you can’t change.

<li>Be active: Being active also helps your body more easily fight stress because it is fit.

<li>Eat well-balanced meals: Staying on track with healthy eating habits is a great way to manage stress.

<li>Rest and sleep:Your body needs time to recover from stressful events, so sleep is an important part of caring for yourself.

<li>Find your stressors and effective ways to cope with them: Remember that you can learn to control stress because stress comes from how you respond to stressful events.

<li>Communicate: Don’t bottle up your emotions, as this will lead to an explosion later on.

<li>Accept yourself: No one is perfect and there is always room for mistakes.

<li>Question your thought pattern: Negative thoughts can take root in your mind and distort the severity of the situation.

<li>Practice focused, deep breathing: Try breathing in for 4 counts and breathing out for 4 counts for 5 minutes total.

<li>Write down your thoughts: Writing down what’s making you anxious gets it out of your head and can make it less daunting.

<li>Listen to music: Listening to music can have a relaxing effect on our minds and bodies, especially classical music. This type of music can have a beneficial effect on our physiological functions, slowing the pulse and heart rate, lowering blood pressure, and decreasing the levels of stress hormones. However, musical preference varies widely between individuals, so only you can decide what you like and what is suitable for each mood. 

<li>Painting: A recently published study (Drexel) proposes that adults may experience a measurable reduction in their cortisol(stress hormone) levels after a 45-minute art making session. </ul>

    <q><h3><i><b>MEDITATION:</b></i></h3>
        <br>
<h4>TYPES OF MEDITATION</h4>
<ul>
<li>Concentration: focusing attention on a single object, internal or external.

<li>Self-Observation: Meditation using the method of self-observation provides an opportunity to look at ourselves objectively.

<li>Movement Meditation: Many forms of meditation encourage you to remain in one position, but movement meditation focuses on the body in motion. Walking meditation is one form of mindful movement; this technique can also be associated with yoga or tai chi and other martial arts.
  
<li>Visualization Meditation: In this meditation technique, an image that creates a particular feeling or quality is brought to mind. For example A Mountain, a Lake, or a Beach.

<li>Chanting Meditation: Many spiritual paths recommend chanting and mantra meditation. While chanting, the mind should be focused on the sound of the words and melody. 

<li>Compassion: It focuses directly on the cultivation of compassion. This involves envisioning negative events and recasting them in a positive light by transforming them through compassion. </ul>

<br>
<h4>THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND WHILE MEDITATING</h4>
<ul>

<li>Your spine should be absolutely erect, from the lower back to the neck, and you should ideally not lean on anything. 

<li>You should meditate in a spot where you can sit uninterrupted. 

<li>Your body should not be exhausted. So do not meditate right after heavy exercise.

<li>Your  mind should be awake. 

<li>Your stomach should not be full. Wait 2-3 hours after heavy meals.

<li>Put your phone on airplane mode while you’re meditating.

<li>You should wear clothes that are comfortable and loose.</ul>

<br>
<h4>ADVANTAGES</h4>

It helps lower your blood pressure, improve your blood circulation, lower your heart rate, lessen perspiration, slow down your respiratory rate, lower your blood cortisol levels, better your focus, lessen anxiety, increase creativity, increase grey matter among other things.<br></q>
