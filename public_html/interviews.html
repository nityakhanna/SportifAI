                           Last year I suffered an injury that prevented me from playing soccer, a sport I love. This impacted my mental health a lot and I felt alone. I then decided to create this platform where mental health was spoken about openly.  I conducted interviews on teenagers to discuss their struggles with mental health to show others that they aren't alone. There are also articles written by teenagers who wanted to share their stories with others! I hope these videos and articles help you! <br>

<br><q>No matter what we look like, we will always be insecure about our bodies. In this interview, I spoke to <i>Keya Kalra Gupta</i>, a 16-year-old ballerina about her struggles with body image.<br>
She and I spoke about how her insecurities originated and how they impact her daily life and mental health. She also gave very interesting and sincere advice to all those watching this interview. I hope this helps you!

<br><q>We always tend to focus on how people successfully balance extracurriculars and academics but often that is far from reality. In this interview, <i>Arshya Nanda</i>, a soccer player, and I discuss how it's not easy to balance soccer and studies.<br>
She and I spoke about how being under too much pressure to perform exceptionally well in both soccer and studies impacted her mental health and her passion for soccer. We spoke about how something that pressure becomes too much and how she coped with it. She also gave genuine advice to anyone who is in the same situation as her. I hope this helps you!

<br><q>Injuries can be devastating and can make you feel very isolated and alone. 
In this interview, I spoke to <i>Kanav Khanna</i>, a 19-year-old soccer player.  He and I discussed his injury and how it impacted his mental and physical health. We also spoke about how he copes with his mental and physical block. He also gave some great advice to anyone who might need it! I hope this helps you!
